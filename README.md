# LLM Evaluation Dashboard

LLM Evaluation Dashboard is a full-stack web application designed to evaluate, compare, and visualize the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) using structured metrics and interactive data dashboards.

This project was built to simulate a real-world evaluation system where multiple LLMs can be tested against standardized prompts and assessed using quantitative and qualitative scoring criteria.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

As large language models become central to modern AI systems, comparing their performance across different benchmarks is critical. This dashboard provides a centralized interface to:

- Evaluate multiple LLM outputs
- Compare results side-by-side
- Analyze performance using structured metrics
- Visualize trends using interactive charts
- Make informed decisions based on evaluation data

The application focuses on clarity, scalability, and clean UI architecture.

## 🎯 Why I Built This Project

I built this project to:

- Gain hands-on experience with LLM evaluation workflows
- Understand how benchmarking systems are structured
- Build a data-driven dashboard with real-world use cases
- Strengthen my frontend architecture and visualization skills
- Simulate production-style AI tooling systems

This project reflects my interest in AI systems, evaluation methodologies, and modern frontend engineering.
